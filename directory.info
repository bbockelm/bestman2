# Branch/Merging
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn-book.html#svn.branchmerge

1. To create a temporary workspace
% cd bestman2
% svn copy trunk branches/osg

2. To update changes from trunk to branches:
% cd bestman2/branches/osg
% svn merge ^/bestman2/trunk

3. To merge integrate back into trunk from the working branch:
% cd bestman2/trunk
% svn update
% svn merge --reintegrate ^/bestman2/branches/osg
% svn delete ^/bestman2/branches/osg
Note: Once a --reintegrate merge is done from branch to trunk, the branch is 
    no longer usable for further work. It's not able to correctly absorb new 
    trunk changes, nor can it be properly reintegrated to trunk again. 
    For this reason, if you want to keep working on your feature branch, 
    we recommend destroying it and then re-creating it from the trunk.
